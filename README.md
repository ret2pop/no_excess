# NoExcess
This is basically a scheme-like language that is aimed to
be scheme with no additional fluff. The programming language
is "done" now in the sense that it is turing complete and
there are some features like strings, ints, floats, booleans, and
some built-in functions to make he language usable, though
I plan to add support for macros and other stuff. This
is a functional programming language so functions are first-class.

## TODO
- [X] Write the lexer
- [X] Write the parser
- [X] Write hash table
- [X] Write the visitor
- [ ] Write the print functions
